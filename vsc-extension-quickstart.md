# Welcome to your VS Code Extension

## What's in the folder
* This folder contains all of the files necessary for your extension
* `package.json` - this is the manifest file that defines the location of the theme file
and specifies the base theme of the theme
* `themes/Material-Theme.tmTheme` - the color theme definition file

## Get up and running straight away
* press `F5` to open a new window with your extension loaded
* open `File > Preferences > Color Themes` and pick your color theme

## Make changes
* you can relaunch the extension from the debug toolbar after making changes to the files listed above
* you can also reload (`Ctrl+R` or `Cmd+R` on Mac) the VS Code window with your extension to load your changes

## Install your extension
* To start using your extension with Visual Studio Code copy it into the <user home>/.vscode/extensions folder and restart Code.
* To share your extension with the world, read on https://code.visualstudio.com/docs about publishing an extension.
