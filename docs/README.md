## Install
Using the Extensions menu, search for **'One Dark Pro'**. Don't forget to apply the theme (see below).

## Apply
Press `ctrl(⌘) + k`, then press `ctrl(⌘) + t`, you will see a theme selection interface. Choose **'One Dark Pro'**.

## Develop 
If you see any inconsistencies or missing colors, the following guide will show you how to make your own changes. You can submit your improvements as a merge request to this theme.

Clone this repo
```
$ git clone git@github.com:Binaryify/OneDark-Pro.git
```
Then run

```
$ yarn
```

Then use vscode open and press `F5` key

Change the `src/themes/themeData.ts` or `src/themes/data/*` file then reload vscode and you will see the change

You also can use `npm run package` to package extension file, the *.vsic file will be generate, then use vscode install the vsic file

### Principle
VS Code will parse code and specify a scope for each piece of syntax. For example, the scope may be a keyword, a constant, or punctuation. **'themeData.ts'** includes the settings that tell VS Code how to format the text accordingly, using these scopes.

### Common scope list

```
comment
constant
constant.character.escape
constant.language
constant.numeric
declaration.section entity.name.section
declaration.tag
deco.folding
entity.name.function
entity.name.tag
entity.name.type
entity.other.attribute-name
entity.other.inherited-class
invalid
invalid.deprecated.trailing-whitespace
keyword
keyword.control.import
keyword.operator.js
markup.heading
markup.list
markup.quote
meta.embedded
meta.preprocessor
meta.section entity.name.section
meta.tag
storage
storage.type.method
string
string source
string.unquoted
support.class
support.constant
support.function
support.type
support.variable
text source
variable
variable.language
variable.other
variable.parameter
```

### Get code scope
VS Code comes with a built-in tool to easily obtain the scope of a piece of syntax. 

Press `ctrl(⌘) + shift + P`, then type `dev`, and choose **"Developer: Inspect TM Scopes"** option.

This will show you the selected token's scope. There are four sections:

- the in-scope piece of syntax

- language, token type, etc.

- the theme rule and shows the foreground color of the token

- the list of scopes for the token

### Add/Change code color
Now you know the rules for the theme, you simply need the code scope and the hex color you would like. Now edit the **'themeData.ts'** file, add/change code snippet like this:

```js
{
      "name": "c++ function",
      "scope": "meta.function.c",
      "settings": {
        "foreground":  colorObj['coral']
      }
}
```


### Reload
Then press `ctrl(⌘) + shift + P`, type **'reload'** and press `enter`. Once the window has reloaded, you will find the color of the code has changed.

## Tweaks & theming
If you want to play around with new colors, use the setting `workbench.colorCustomizations` to customize the currently selected theme.
For example, you can add this snippet in your "settings.json" file:

```json
"workbench.colorCustomizations":{
    "tab.activeBackground": "#282c34",
    "activityBar.background": "#282c34",
    "sideBar.background": "#282c34"
}
```

or use the setting `editor.tokenColorCustomizations`

```json
"editor.tokenColorCustomizations":{
    "[One Dark Pro]": {
      "textMateRules": [
        {
          "scope":["source.python"],
          "settings": {
            "foreground": "#e06c75"
          }
        }
      ]
    }
}
```
